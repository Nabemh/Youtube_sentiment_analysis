    "description": "Get 20% off Car Vertical using code Carwow: https://bit.ly/Carwow-Car-Vertical\n\nMat’s flown over to Germany to get his hands on the all-new Porsche 911 Turbo S! \n\nIt’s finally time for him to put it through its paces, taking it on a drive through town, on a twisty road, and even on some de-restricted Autobahn! \n\nThe question is, how much has it improved compared to its predecessor? And is it worth the huge £199,000 price tag? Let’s take a closer look…\n\nIn terms of the design, it’s still unmistakably a 911 from the outside. Around the back, there are new vents at the rear for the intercoolers for the engine’s new hybrid tech, and these are flanked by huge quad tailpipes. There’s also the now-standard full-length light bar. Along the side of the rear of the car is wider, with side vents to help smooth air flow around the car. There’s also a carbon fibre roof (although that’s an optional extra). Up front, there’s an all-new headlight cluster that houses all lights, and there are vents within the bumper that can close at higher speeds to improve dynamics.\n\nGiven that this is only a mid-life facelift, the design of the interior remains largely similar to that of the previous car. There’s carbon fibre on the dash, fully digital dials, and the starter switch has been swapped to a button. Otherwise, the interior of the new Turbo S is largely the same as before - but that’s no bad thing! \n\nThe new Porsche 911 Turbo S is powered by a 3.6-litre twin-turbo flat-six that produces 711hp and 800Nm. It’s also the first Turbo S to come with hybrid technology included, with the T-Hybrid system including a small electric motor in the gearbox to give it some serious punch. As a result, the new 911 Turbo S has a 0-60mph time of just 2.5 seconds, and a top speed of 322km/h! \n\nSo, is the new Turbo S an improvement on its predecessor? You’ll need to stick with Mat to see for yourself!\n\nHuge thanks to THT Performance for their help with the dyno test!\n\n- https://www.tht-performance.de/\n- https://www.instagram.com/tht_performance/\n- https://youtube.com/@tht-performance1201\n\nChapters\n00:00 Intro\n02:10 Design\n04:33 Interior\n05:40 Back Seats\n06:18 Engine\n07:23 Driving\n11:08 Dyno Test\n16:00 Cruising\n16:54 0-60mph\n17:33 Dynamic Chassis\n18:33 Twisty Road Driving\n20:48 Price\n22:56 Autobahn Driving\n28:48 Verdict\n\nOur merch store is now LIVE: https://bit.ly/Carwow-Merchandise",
